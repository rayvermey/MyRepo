BSPWM + Panel (Dual-Monitor) Dotfiles 
====================================
I have a dual-monitor setup and for the panel (LemonBoy's bar - bar ain't recursive) I only found a few single-monitor dotfiles. I merged some of these BSPWM and Panel dotfiles together and ended up with a beautiful dual-monitor panel. So I would like to thank you:
* [thegnome dotfiles](https://github.com/thegnome/dotfiles) (maybe I will buy you a crate of beer)
* [windelicato dotfiles](https://github.com/windelicato/dotfiles)

Dependencies (Arch Linux)
-------------------------
* [bspwm-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bspwm-git/)
* [sxhd](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sxhkd/)
* [bar-aint-recursive](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bar-aint-recursive/)
* [xtitle](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xtitle-git/)
* [trayer-srg w multi monitor support](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/trayer-srg-git/)
* [Lemon Font](https://github.com/phallus/fonts)

Here's What It Looks Like

By the way the panel has mouse-support so you can click on the workspace to switch to it.
